# autosnab_mvp Current Status

- Wiki bootstrap integrated into this repo on 2026-07-02.
- The knowledge base now lives under `docs/wiki/` in `autosnab_mvp`.
- Local raw-root created at `../autosnab_mvp_raw` for source documents outside Git.
- Next maintenance step: keep wiki writeback in sync with code changes and register any new raw files in `manifests/raw_sources.csv`.
- New SBIS EDO requirements were received on 2026-07-02 and compiled into `docs/wiki/sbis-edo-integration.md`.
- Additional screenshot intake on 2026-07-02 reinforced the centralized OCR/document-flow requirement and pointed to an existing Google Docs table named `АвтоСнаб Кафе Ромашка`.
- Architectural conclusion: SBIS EDO should be implemented as a source adapter over a shared document core, not wired directly into the current invoice-review flow.
- Parallel PDF export development means the shared document contract must be frozen early so the two tracks do not diverge.
- Final execution plan is now recorded in `docs/wiki/sbis-edo-integration.md`: freeze the contract, add SBIS as an adapter, keep the PDF flow unchanged, and validate both sources through one writer.
- New screenshot on 2026-07-03 updates delivery priority: MVP recognition/table placement this week, SBIS EDO next week.
- Meeting notes on 2026-07-03 add a nearer-term focus on multi-page document UX and parsing strategy before SBIS work starts.
- Latest intake on 2026-07-03 adds table-layout constraints: keep header names stable, use the existing Apps Script behavior, and treat the table as a document-level validation layer with a planned `Вернуть на проверку` action.

## Today summary

- The project is a document-processing pipeline, not a generic document store.
- The current MVP priority is to show reliable document recognition and placement into the existing validation table.
- Multi-page UX, parsing reliability, and stable table headers are the critical short-term risks.
- SBIS EDO is the next phase, but only after the shared document contract is frozen.
- PDF and SBIS must stay as source adapters over one common document core.
